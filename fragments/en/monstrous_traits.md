# Monstrous Traits

Every monster can have its own set of racial, ancestral, and biological quirks—traits that are born about by the monster's inherent nature.

This chapter introduces _monstrous traits_ to help you flesh out the physiology of your monsters.

## Choosing Traits

A trait describes something _innate_ about your monster—how it moves, what it can sense, how it behaves and reacts, etc. These are the fundamental facts of your monster's physiology—things that simply _are_ because of ancestry, culture, or biology.

Equip your monster with a trait when you want to make a particular characteristic significant in-game.

### Trait Categories

Monstrous traits are grouped together into 14 _creature categories_ with assorted keywords.

Use these creature categories as a starting point when you select traits for your monster—though feel free to mix-and-match traits from any category as best befits your monster.

### Additional Details

Some traits may require you to define a specific detail or range—for example:

* **Variant Damage:** Choose one particular damage type.
* **Variant Save:** Choose one particular saving throw.
* **Saving Throw DC:** If your trait requires a target to make a saving throw, define the DC.
* **Distances:** Choose a distance or range (typically measured in feet).

\exampleBegin

The GM wants to add some traits to a psionic, humanoid monster. To get started, they choose one trait from the _humanoid_ list (Trance). Then, to reflect the monster's _mental abilities_, they choose one trait from the _aberration_ list (Telepathic Bond).

A second GM is building a dracolich and wants to add some appropriate traits. They choose one trait from the _undead_ list (Phylactery) and then one trait from the _dragon_ list (Frightening Aura).
