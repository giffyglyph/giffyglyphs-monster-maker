# Overkill Attacks

The biggest, scariest monsters need the biggest, scariest attacks. When the party's on the verge of thwarting your plans—or have suddenly put themselves in a vulnerable position—it's time to unleash your full power and go into overkill. Take no prisoners, and leave no adventurer alive.

This chapter introduces a cinematic, automatically-hitting attack—<en>overkill attacks</em>—and how to use them in your encounters.

## Going Into Overkill

An _overkill attack_ is a huge, devastating, and almost certainly fatal attack that elites and paragons can unleash against the party. These are your biggest, most cinematic attacks—an ultimate technique that can destroy PCs, NPCs, and scenery alike:

1. **Charge:** You spend an action on your turn to start charging up the attack—drawing in breath, channelling mana, gathering strength, etc.
2. **Focused:** Charging the attack takes all of your attention—you can't move or take actions/reactions.
3. **Vulnerable:** Charging the attack may expose a weak point that—if reduced to 0 hit points—will stun you.
4. **Unleash:** The attack finishes charging at the start of your next turn. You then spend the entirety of your turn unleashing the attack.
5. **Hit:** Any valid target still in range of the attack is hit automatically.
6. **Damage:** You deal a massive amount of damage, equal to four times your base damage.
7. **Destroy:** If the attack is _extreme_, any target reduced to 0 hit points is immediately killed.

<!-- Overkill attacks take a full round to charge up but a) hit anyone in range _automatically_ and b) deal a massive amount of damage in the process—four times the normal damage. -->

<!-- ## Making an Attack

There are 6 steps to creating an overkill attack:

1. **Pick a trigger:** Decide what type of event triggers the start of the overkill attack. You take a lot of damage? Players destroy all your minions? You grab a PC?
2. **Choose the area:** Overkill attacks automatically hit anything within a target area. Choose the area and range—as well as any possible safe spots.
3. **Calculate the damage:** Overkill attacks do four times the damage of normal attacks—calculate just how devastating the attack will be to your players. -->

\panelBegin { "class": "panel--aside", "title": "Cinematic Spectacle" }

Overkill attacks are a great way to add some cinematic spectacle to your battles and end-game bosses, creating spikes of danger and tension throughout battle to put your players in peril.

Use plenty of over-the-top description to make your overkill attacks big, loud, and exciting. Highlight the deadly power of your monsters.

\panelEnd

\contentEnd

\contentBegin { "class": "page--mm-overkill-attacks" }

## Creating an Attack

To make an overkill attack for your monster or hazard, follow these three steps:

### Pick a Trigger { "index": "1" }

First, you must decide exactly _when_ the attack can be used. Does your scaler go into overkill when bloodied? When it's grabbed a player? When the players disrupt a sacred ritual circle?

Pick an event from the list below to get started—or create your own. When the event is triggered, your overkill attack is unlocked.

\panelBegin { "class": "panel--table", "title": "Overkill Triggers" }

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Bloodied|You are reduced to 50% or fewer hit points.|
|Event|The party does something that disrupts your plans—release a prisoner, disrupt a ritual, destroy a power crystal, etc.|
|Free|No restriction—you can perform this attack whenever you like.|
|Peril|A player is in a perilous condition—grappled, restrained, stunned, etc.|

\panelEnd

\exampleBegin

The GM wants to create an overkill attack for a 9th-level paragon striker—Kaladraxis, a vainglorious red dragon with a fiery temperament.

To get started, the GM picks the "Bloodied" trigger. When Kaladraxis is hurt by the adventurers, he's going to get very, _very_ angry...

\exampleEnd

### Choose the Range & Targets { "index": "2" }

Next, decide the range and targets of the attack. Overkill attacks almost-always originate from _you_, striking out at anyone unfortunate enough to still be in range. Pick a basic template from the list below to get started:

\panelBegin { "class": "panel--table", "title": "Overkill Area" }

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Aimed|Hits one or more specific targets—such as a grabbed or stunned player within reach.|
|Area|Hits everyone within a certain area—a cone, a sphere, a line, etc.|
|Zone|The attack fills an entire zone or arbitrary region of the map.|

\panelEnd

\exampleBegin

In his rage, Kaladraxis' overkill attack will flood the entire chamber with searing dragonbreath.

Instead of a _traditional_ dragonbreath cone, the GM chooses an area template (centered on Kaladraxis) with a 40 ft. radius—the party will have to run for their lives to escape the dragon's hellish flames...

\exampleEnd

\columnbreak

#### The Danger Zone

Make sure that it's possible for your players (at least, _most_ of them) to get out of range of the attack in only one turn—even if it means dashing.

If your players can only move 30 ft. with a move action, for example, avoid using a 70 ft. area for your overkill attack unless the players have either a) a clear means of escape or b) safe spots to take cover in.

#### Safe Spots

When you build an encounter, make sure to add some interesting scenery that players can use in creative ways to protect themselves—pillars to hide behind, tables to flip over for cover, pools of water to dive into, dead magic zones that nullify magical overkill, etc.

\exampleBegin

The GM adds a couple of stone pillars to the encounter scenery as possible cover—but not enough for every player. They'll have to decide who gets to hide and who gets to run—fast.

\exampleEnd

### Determine the Damage { "index": "3" }

Now, it's time to see how much damage your attack will do. Overkill attacks deal up to _four times_ your regular base damage—enough to kill a healthy adventurer in one hit.

Overkill attacks shouldn't be taken lightly, so make sure to highlight the grave danger.

\exampleBegin

As a 9th-level paragon striker, Kaladraxis deals 28 base damage. This means his overkill attack will deal 112 fire damage—almost _certain_ to kill any unfortunate creature caught in the blast.

\exampleEnd

#### Extreme Overkill { "class": "option" }

If you want to make players _really_ afraid of your overkill attack, make it _extreme_.

If a player is reduced to 0 hit points by an extreme overkill attack, they are killed outright—any remaining death saves automatically fail.

  </ul>
</div>

\contentEnd

\contentBegin { "class": "page--mm-overkill-attacks" }

## Using an Attack

To use an overkill attack, follow these three steps:

### Telegraph the Attack { "index": 1 }

Take an action to start your overkill attack and telegraph the impending danger—everyone should know what's coming up so that they have a chance to avoid it.

Describe _what_ is happening, _where_ it will happen, and _when_ it will happen. Make it clear that any valid target not in adequate cover will be hit <em>automatically</em>—the only defense is to be out of the attack range.

\exampleBegin

Inside _Redstone Volcano_, Valiant, Krazak, and Clanda battle Kaladraxis, the wild red dragon. When he is bloodied, Kaladraxis uses an overkill attack.

---

* **GM:** The red dragon Kaladraxis starts to draw in breath. Valiant, you can see its chest swell with dangerous power—an incredible amount of heat is radiates from the dragon as it goes into _overkill_.
* **Kaladraxis:** Insolent mortals, you will all _burn_!
* **Valiant:** Can I see where Kaladraxis is aiming?
* **GM:** You think he's going to flood this entire chamber with searing, deadly flame in just six seconds.
* **Valiant:** Uh, everyone? _We should probably run_.

\exampleEnd

### Charge up Power { "index": 2 }

When you go into overkill, you charge up power. While charging, your speed is reduced to 0 and you can't take actions or reactions (nor spend _paragon power_).

If you are stunned, fall unconscious, or are otherwise put in a position where you can't reasonable charge up your overkill attack, the action fizzles to no effect.

\exampleBegin

* **GM:** The heat from Kaladraxis is intense as the dragonfire builds. What do you do, Krazak?
* **Krazak:** Dragon can't breathe fire if it's stunned. And my _Stormbreaker_ axe can stun on a crit...
* **GM:** You attack the dragon?
* **Krazak:** Damn right I attack the dragon! I charge at Kaladraxis with Stormbreaker drawn. Ancestors, if ever I needed a critical it's now... <span class="chat__action">(rolls 1)</span> ..._son of a_.
* **GM:** The heat throws off your swing, Krazak. You skid to a halt in front of the grinning dragon...

\exampleEnd

\panelBegin { "class": "panel--aside", "title": "Explain the Mechanics" }

When you introduce overkill attacks into your game, be sure that your players are aware and understand the mechanic—otherwise they may expect to be able to use their normal defensive abilities, or may not anticipate such high damage from a single attack.

\panelEnd

\columnbreak

### Reveal a Weak Point { "index": 3 }

While you are charging an overkill attack, you may reveal a weak point of some kind—a delicate crystal core, a loose dragon scale, a fragile magic rune, etc.

This weak point has HP equal to 10% of your total hit points and—by default—shares your defences.

If this weak point is reduced to 0 hit points, you a) immediately take damage equal to the weak point's maximum HP and b) are _stunned_ until the end of your next turn. These effects can't be circumvented by any means—resistances, immunities, _paragon power_, etc.

\exampleBegin

While Kaladraxis is charging up his overkill attack, he reveals an environmental weak spot—a fragile-looking stalactite hanging directly above him with 38 hit points (10% of Kaladraxis' 383 HP) and 18 AC.

If the stalactite is reduced to 0 hit points, it falls onto Kaladraxis—the dragon will take 38 points of damage and be _stunned_ until the end of his next turn.

---

* **GM:** Steam vents from the dragon's scales—there isn't much time left. Clanda, what do you do?
* **Clanda:** First, I'll duck behind this pillar _just in case_. Second, I want to break that stalactite you described with a 5th-level <em>Shatter</em>—bring it right down onto that dragon's smug face. That'll be... (rolls 6d8) ...34 points of thunder damage!
* **GM:** Explosive thunder echoes throughout the cavern. The stalactite cracks... but it's _not enough_.
* **Clanda:** ...Oh dear.

\exampleEnd

A weak point can only be seen or attacked while you are in overkill. If you want to bait players into staying within your overkill range, expose a weak point.

### Attack { "index": "4" }

The overkill attack is fully charged at the start of your next turn, and you must use your full turn to unleash it. Any target in range is automatically hit with full damage—make sure to describe this with cinematic spectacle.

After the end of your turn, once the overkill attack has been resolved, you can act as normal.

\exampleBegin

* **GM:** "You will turn to ash!" roars Kaladraxis as he breathes volcanic dragonfire into the chamber.
* **Clanda:** We're all safe behind this pillar, right?
* **GM:** You and Valiant are—but Krazak isn't. The dwarf, standing his ground, is hit full force by the _extreme_ attack. He takes 112 points of fire damage.
* **Krazak:** ...I'm down to 0 hit points. Damn. I stand defiant, my charred arm holding aloft a melted axe. "That. All. You. Got?" And then I fall.
* **GM:** Krazak's body disintegrates into ash as it hits the ground—the dwarf is no more. Kaladraxis laughs, scattering the ashes with a tail swipe.
* **Kaladraxis:** One down, _two to go_.
